    <p> As a young student in east Tennesee, Adrienne received a strong foundation from her sister, Anne May, who taught her with a combination of traditional reading and Suzuki methods. She received her Bachelor of Music in Piano Pedagogy and Literature from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, where she studied with Fay Adams. She also studied harpsichord and organ with John Brock, piano literature with Dr. David Brunell, and collaborative piano with Dr. Christy Lee.  During her time at UTK she began her professional involvement with MTNA (Music Teachers National Association) acting in many roles including President. For two summers in college Adrienne studied with James Howsmon at Brevard Music Center in North Carolina and worked with Dr. Barbara Lister-Sink which began her interest in a relaxed, tension-free approach to the piano.</p>
    <p>Upon moving to Louisville, Adrienne began studies with Dr. Vernon Cherrix and continued throughout graduate school at the University of Louisville. She worked closely with Dr. Krista Wallace-Boaz as a graduate teaching assistant as she worked towards her Master of Music in Piano Pedagogy. Working with Dr. Jean Christensen, she developed an interest in contemporary pedagogical material from around the world.</p>
    <p>During her studies in both Knoxville and Louisville she was fortunate to participate and attend masterclasses given by pianists Kotaro Fukuma, Wendy Chen, Awadagin Pratt and Van Cliburn medalists Olga Kern, Stanislav Oudenitch, Maxim Phillipov, and Yekwon Sunwoo.</p>
    <p>As a pianist, Adrienne has experience playing with vocalists, string, brass, woodwind, and percussionists. She served as pianist and keyboardist with the Thompson Street Opera Company for three years which produces contemporary operas and was pianist for the University of Louisville’s Singing Cardsmen. She finds that these experiences also give her a enhanced approach to collaboration and teaching her private students. </p>
    <p>Adrienne became faculty at the Indiana University-Southeast music department and Arts Institute in 2017. She teaches both college and pre-college, preparatory department students in addition to her Louisville studio. As a teacher Adrienne works with each student’s strengths to develop positive self-critique and discipline as well as poise and confidence. Her students work on technique, history, and theory and how they relate to their repertoire. </p>
    <p>Each student is an individual and so each lesson is tailored to their needs and they are allowed to explore concepts that motivate them. From improvisation to contemporary techniques and composers, students are encouraged to seek knowledge beyond their weekly lesson. They are given a safe place to grow, be themselves, and explore the piano and all it has to share.</p>
