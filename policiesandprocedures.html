<h1> Piano Studio Policy : 2018 - 2019 </h1>
<h2>Lessons</h2>
<p>Weekly lessons provide guidance and an opportunity for parents, students, and teacher
to ask questions. Regular attendance is important and students must arrive on time. If a
student arrives late, their lesson will still end at the scheduled time. There is no refund
for a shortened lesson due to a student’s tardiness. Depending on the age and ability
level of the student, lessons will range from thirty (30) minutes to an hour.
Parents are welcome and invited to sit in on lessons. Concentration is essential to a
beneficial lesson and if there is excessive distraction, I will ask for visitors to leave.
Students’ friends should not attend lessons without advance notice.
Students must bring all materials to lessons each week. Lesson time is wasted and
progress stunted having to search for replacement materials. If this becomes a regular
pattern of behavior, students will be excused from lessons.

Lessons will cover a variety of areas including technical skills, repertoire, theory, sight-
reading, improvisation, Communicationand music history.</p>
<h2>Communication</h2>

<P>If you need to speak with me personally, please do so at the beginning of your child’s
lesson time so as not to interrupt another student’s lesson.</p>
<h2>The House & Parking</h2>

<p>Parking is at a premium. If you arrive and the driveway is full, there are a few options.
The neighbor across the street at 519 Washburn (small yellow house with double-wide
driveway) has offered to let students park there for entire lessons. Please park to the
right side of the driveway so that she has access as well. Please use extreme caution
crossing the street.
The neighbor to the left at 518 Washburn, towards New LaGrange Rd, has said
students may pull into their driveway for pick up and drop off. Do not park there for an
extended period of time.
Do not park in the driveway of the house to the right, towards Westport Rd at 520 1/2
Washburn.
Warwick Park is directly behind the house and provides ample parking. Do not enter
through my backyard.</p>

<h2>Tuition & the Calendar</h2>
<h2>TUITION FOR THE 2018-2019 YEAR IS AS FOLLOWS</h2>

<p>30 minutes $382/term or $76.50/month
45 minutes $566.25/term or $113.25/month
60 minutes $750/term or $150/month
75 minutes $933.75/term or $186.75/month
90 minutes $1117.50/term or $223.50/month</P>
<p>The semester is made up of fifteen (15) lessons over the course of 17-18 weeks. This
gives flexibility to miss a lesson, both for student and myself, due to school breaks,
personal reasons, performances, or other activities. I cannot guarantee make up
lessons.</p>
<p>Tuition is figured by the semester and may be paid in installments or in whole at the
start of the term. Payments are due by the 10th of the month. Any late payments incur a
$20 fee. Tuition is figured as such: $49/hr x 15 lessons + $15 studio maintenance fee.</p>
</p>
<p>Please understand that tuition reserves a space in my weekly calendar and if tuition is
    not received, the space in my schedule is forfeited. There are no refunds and credits are
    made at my discretion. Tuition increases by $1/hour at the start of each academic year.</p>
<p>I understand emergencies and sicknesses occur. If a student is sick and possibly
    contagious, do not come to piano. We all share the same instrument!</p>
<p>If a lesson is missed with no communication there will be absolutely no opportunity for a
    make up. If you must miss, please send an email for confirmation.</p>
    <p>Students are responsible for purchasing materials such as method books and
        supplemental material or reimbursing me for purchase. If a student loses a personal
        score of mine, they will be expected to replace it.</p>
        <h2>Inclement Weather</h2>
        <p>Since I teach at home, you will make the final decision about whether you feel safe
            traveling to piano. If you do not feel safe, you will not be penalized for choosing to miss
            a lesson due to snow and ice.</p>
            <h2>Summer Lessons</h2>
            <p>Students are strongly urged to take advantage of Summer lessons in June and July.
                These ensure that progress made during the year is not lost. Individual students who
                take the equivalent of six regular-term lessons will receive priority scheduling for Fall.
                Registration for summer lessons takes place online and you are in control of when they
                happen.</p>
                <h2>“Practice only on the days you eat.”</h2>
                <p>Practicing is the backbone to every musician’s success. Please make piano practice a
                    part of the daily routine in the same way as math and reading homework. A quiet and
                    comfortable space at home, free from distractions, will provide the best environment for
                    good practice.</p>
                    <p>Individual practice suggestions will be made but a general rule is daily practice for the
                        length of the weekly lesson (i.e. 30 minute less, 30 minutes of practice per day, 5-7 days
                        a week).</p>
                        <p>Please do not turn practicing into punishment. This is the quickest way to sour a music
                            to student study. Let me know if there is difficulty getting a student to practice. Practice
                            MUST be done between lessons for any progress to be made. Younger students will
                            need more parental involvement to develop a healthy practice routine. If a student does
                            not develop a regular practice habit I reserve the right to dismiss them from the studio.</p>
                    <h2>The Home Instrument</h2>
                    <p>The instrument at home must be key in tune and have a registered piano technician
                        tend to it at least once or twice a year, preferably as the weather changes. Practicing on
                        an out of tune or poorly functioning instrument can prove difficult, unrewarding, and
                        eventually lead to a desire to quit piano altogether. Acoustic pianos are an investment
                        but will provide the most rewarding progress. Once the decision to invest in an acoustic
                        piano has been made I am happy to help in the process of choosing an appropriate
                        instrument.</p>
                        <p>A digital keyboard is acceptable as long as it has 88 weighted keys and is kept at an
                            appropriate height, on a sturdy stand. The keyboard should not be placed on a bed,
                            table, or the floor. Toys and keyboards that are not full size will create difficulties and
                            make proper, healthy technique impossible to establish. All reasonable effort should be
                            made to transition to an acoustic piano as progress occurs.</p>
                        <h2>Recitals</h2>   
                        <p>There are two recitals each year, Fall and Spring. Please make them a priority. The
                            recital offers an opportunity to show progress, build confidence, and cultivate stage
                            presence. With the exception of beginning students and those playing duets/chamber
                            music, all students’ performances will be memorized and performed without music.</p> 
                         <p>The student and I will choose recital repertoire. Once the music is chosen it cannot be
                            changed. Doing so abbreviates the time we have to truly learn the music and puts the
                            student at a disadvantage.</p>
                            <h2>The Hands</h2> 
                            <p>Keep nails trimmed and hands clean.</p> 
                            <p>Washing hands before lessons keeps the instrument clean and prevents the passage of
                                germs from student to student.</p>
                                <p>If a student suffers an injury to a hand or arm, do not fret! Piano lessons can continue
                                    with one hand alone and adjustments made to the curriculum until students are
                                    medically released to use both hands/arms. I will never go in opposition to a doctor’s
                                    orders for best healing.</p>
